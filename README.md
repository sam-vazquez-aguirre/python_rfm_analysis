# **RFM Analysis & Customer Segmentation**

## **Project Overview** 📌
This project focuses on identifying high-value customers and churn risks within the retail industry. Using an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) framework, I segmented a database of 4,000+ customers to drive data-informed marketing strategies and deliver actionable business insights.

## **Key Insights** 🚀
**The 10/60 rule**: Only 10% of the customer base (Champions) generates 60% of total revenue.

**Frequency is the engine**: While Average Order Value (AOV) is relatively consistent across segments, Champions purchase 19 times on average, compared to only 7 times for "Loyal" customers.

**Retention over upselling**: The data suggests that growth for the brand isn't about making customers spend more per visit, but about increasing the number of visits.

## **Tools & Methodology** 🛠️
**Python (Pandas & NumPy)**: Data cleaning and logic-based segmentation using np.select.

**Tableau**: Interactive dashboarding to visualize financial impact (Treemap) and risk distribution.

**RFM Metrics**: Custom scoring (1-5) to categorize customers into 8 distinct business segments.

## **Visualizations** 📊
You can explore the interactive version of the dashboard here: ((coming soon)).

## **Strategic Recommendations** 💡
VIP Frequency Program: Launch an exclusive "premium tier" to incentivize "Loyal" customers (7 orders) to reach the 19-order milestone.

High-Value Recovery: Prioritize the "At Risk (High Value)" segment with personalized re-engagement campaigns to prevent the loss of historically high-frequency buyers.
